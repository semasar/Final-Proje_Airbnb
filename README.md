## Airbnb Price Prediction Machine Learning Project


## Project Overview
This machine learning project aims to predict the prices of Airbnb listings based on various features and attributes. The idea is to create a predictive model that can assist both hosts and guests in determining appropriate pricing for their properties or selecting suitable accommodations within their budget

## Data Source
The dataset used for this project is obtained from Airbnb, and it contains various attributes of listings, such as property type, number of bedrooms, amenities, location, and historical pricing. The dataset may also include reviews and ratings that can be utilized for sentiment analysis or feature engineering.

## Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing is a crucial step in this project. It involves cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, removing outliers, and converting categorical variables into a suitable format for machine learning algorithms.

## Feature Engineering
Feature engineering plays a vital role in improving model performance. New features can be created based on the existing data, such as calculating distances to popular landmarks, generating sentiment scores from reviews, or aggregating information about the neighborhood.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA provides insights into the data and helps identify patterns, correlations, and trends. Visualizations and statistical summaries will be used to gain a better understanding of the dataset.

## Machine Learning Models
Several machine learning algorithms will be explored for Airbnb price prediction. Commonly used regression techniques, such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting, will be trained and evaluated to identify the best-performing model.

## Model Evaluation
The performance of the machine learning models will be assessed using various evaluation metrics, such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R2). Cross-validation will be employed to ensure the models generalize well on unseen data.

## Deployment
The final trained model will be deployed for practical use. A user-friendly interface may be created to allow users to input their listing details and obtain a predicted price.
